# blog-project

I designed and implemented an interactive blog application using React (frontend), express.js, Node.js (backend), and MySQL (database). Incorporated features such as user authentication, post creation on a rich text editor (react-quill), image uploads, categorization, and access restrictions based on post ownership. Enhanced user experience by displaying detailed post information, user details, post timestamps, and suggesting similar post recommendations for users to explore.

Tools used: 
  React, MySQL, Node.js, express, axios
